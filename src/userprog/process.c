PID if all activities lead to successful creationg of a new process

In the current solution the process received same id as the
thread. That is all-right, but other solutions may be more
practical.

Your problems are:
- How to transfer relevant information between the thraeds
- Avoiding to return before you know a process was created
- Avoiding to return before it is safe (see warnings above)

Assume that the ready queue contain the kernel threads IDLE and
OTHER when thread_create is called above. The thread PARENT is
executing. Then make sure you understand:

- Which of the threads are on the ready queue immediately after
the return of thread_create (assuming no thread switches had
time to occur)?

- Assume one thread switch occur after thread create. Which
threads are then on the ready queue, and which thread is
executing? (Two correct answers!)

- Assume another thread switch, back to PARENT thread, to
occur. Is it GUARANTEED that the function start_process have
executed to it's final line, or at all?

- Is it POSSIBLE that the newly created thread happen to be
scheduled and execute it's process to completion before
thread_create even return?

Note that some events may be UNLIKELY but still possible, or
LIKELY but not GUARANTEED. An implementation that depends on
likely or unlikely events is not acceptable. All code must be
GUARANTEED to work in any sequence of (the most unlikely or
likely) events.
