     In the current solution the process received same id as the

     Your problems are:
     - How to transfer relevant information between the thraeds
     - Avoiding to return before you know a process was created
     - Avoiding to return before it is safe (see warnings above)

     Assume that the ready queue contain the kernel threads IDLE and
     OTHER when thread_create is called above. The thread PARENT is
     executing. Then make sure you understand:
     
     - Which of the threads are on the ready queue immediately after
       the return of thread_create (assuming no thread switches had
       time to occur)?

     - Assume one thread switch occur after thread create. Which
       threads are then on the ready queue, and which thread is
       executing? (Two correct answers!)

     - Assume another thread switch, back to PARENT thread, to
       occur. Is it GUARANTEED that the function start_process have
       executed to it's final line, or at all?

     - Is it POSSIBLE that the newly created thread happen to be
       scheduled and execute it's process to completion before
       thread_create even return?

     Note that some events may be UNLIKELY but still possible, or
     LIKELY but not GUARANTEED. An implementation that depends on
     likely or unlikely events is not acceptable. All code must be
     GUARANTEED to work in any sequence of (the most unlikely or
     likely) events.
